// The client half of identity and the record: six calls, and one rule about what
// happens when the gate says no.
//
// The shell is a static file and cannot be gated (worker/index.js says why), so
// the first thing any hub screen does is ask for data and find out. A 401 here
// is not an error to render — it is a navigation to /gate, carrying where we
// were so the gate can put us back.
//
// The two record calls are the exception, and pass `{ gate: false }`. Every
// other call is made by a screen with nothing to show without it, where going to
// the gate is the right answer. Those two are made by a screen with a game
// running on it, and a cookie that expired mid-session must not throw away the
// round in progress — the 401 comes back as an ApiError for the game to say
// something about instead.
//
// Nothing in here touches the DOM, and nothing outside it calls fetch.
