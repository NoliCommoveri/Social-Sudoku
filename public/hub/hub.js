// The hub: the picker, the shelf, the editor, and the switches between them.
//
// Three screens, one page:
//
//   picker   nobody is chosen on this device yet, or somebody tapped to switch.
//            Every live profile as a big face, plus the tile that makes a new
//            one. Tap yours.
//   shelf    the games, and the family strip along the bottom of them.
//   editor   a name and thirty faces. Both ways in are on the picker — the
//            new-player tile, and the button that changes the profile you are
//            already on. That is where they belong: the picker is the screen
//            whose subject is who you are, and the shelf's bar has room for one
//            control rather than two (docs/design-language.md §3, which keeps
//            the front page down to the games and the faces).
//
// The picker comes first on a device that has never been used, because a play
// needs a player and asking once is cheaper than asking on the way into every
// game. After that the shelf is what opens, which is the whole point of the
// `who` cookie: the 12-year-old's phone opens straight to them and the shared
// tablet is cleared back to the picker with the Nobody tile.
//
// Rendering is innerHTML into one container. There is nothing here worth a
// framework, no dependency is allowed, and every screen redraws whole — the
// most this page ever holds is thirty faces and a handful of tiles. The one
// thing that survives a redraw is what has been typed into the editor's name
// field, which is why it is read into state on the way past rather than out of
// the DOM at save time.
